# CookTrace changelog

## v1.0.0-rc.1 (2026-06-07)

First public release candidate. Brings the dev branch to feature
completeness and parity with the wider TraceApps family (NutriTrace,
LiftTrace), then layers polish, dependency upgrades, and the Android
local-mode build that lets CookTrace run standalone on a phone
without a server.

### Android app — standalone or server-connected
- **First-launch wizard** offers Use Locally (pure offline, on-device
  SQLite) or Connect to Server (URL + login). Mode is switchable later
  in Settings, with a merge dialog when bringing existing local data
  to a server for the first time.
- **Differential sync engine** with 30-second background timer +
  visibilitychange resume. Push pending writes, pull recent changes,
  surface real failure messages in the sync banner.
- **Offline image cache**: sync downloads every server image to the
  device so recipe / pantry / diary thumbnails render without a
  connection. Cache filenames are hashed so cross-product collisions
  on OpenFoodFacts URLs no longer overwrite each other.
- **Native barcode scanning** via ML Kit. Capacitor 8 base. Shared
  TraceApps release keystore so reinstalling between dev and release
  builds doesn't wipe local data.

### Recipe importers
- **Mealie**, **Tandoor**, **Paprika** export-zip importers with
  per-recipe selection, dedup, and category / tag carryover.
- **Mealie timeline import**: pulls cook-event history (with photos
  and notes), backdates recipe created_at to the original add date,
  matches cook events to your existing recipes.
- Drag-and-drop file picker, scan + commit two-step flow.

### NutriTrace federation
- **Smart View on OFF / Share to OFF dual button** in the pantry item
  editor. When the barcode already exists on Open Food Facts, the
  button switches to "View on OFF" and opens the product page; when
  it doesn't, the button uploads the local row and reports back with a
  verify status row ("Confirmed live on Open Food Facts" / "Submitted,
  may take a few minutes to appear").
- **Persistent Connected pill** in Settings → NutriTrace federation so
  you can see at a glance whether the integration is working without
  re-running the test.
- **OFF nutriment _modifier filter**: values OFF flags as algorithmic
  estimates (rather than label-derived facts) no longer get imported
  as real measured values.
- **UPC-A → EAN-13 canonical-form normalization** in the OFF lookup so
  12-digit scans hit the same product as their 13-digit equivalents.

### Trace AI assistant
- **Hold-to-record voice on the FAB** for hands-free Smart Log. Hold
  the FAB to start recording (haptic + beep), release to send to the
  AI, slide your finger >100px away to cancel mid-recording. Status
  pill above the FAB shows the gesture state ("Listening… Release to
  Send" / "✕ Release to Cancel").
- **Chat panel** now slides up as a full-width mobile bottom sheet
  with a drag handle, dimmed backdrop, and rounded top corners.
  Desktop keeps the floating-card layout, anchored bottom-right.
- **Always-visible Clear Chat button** in the panel header (was
  hidden when there were no messages).
- **In-chat mic button removed** for parity with NutriTrace and
  LiftTrace — voice now lives only on the FAB hold gesture.

### Nutrition Facts box
- **FDA-correct sodium placement**: sodium moves up into the macros
  block (between Cholesterol and Total Carbohydrate) where it belongs
  on a real food label, rather than sitting under Protein in its own
  rule.
- **Servings per recipe** line added above the Serving Size, matching
  the "Servings Per Container" pattern on packaging.
- **Per-serving grams when computable**: the Serving Size line shows
  `~85g` instead of `1 of 8` when every ingredient in the recipe
  resolves to a known weight or density. Otherwise it falls back to
  `1 of N` or `Per serving`.

### Pantry item editor (single unified surface)
- **Slide-up sheet** is now the single editor for every pantry-item
  flow (view, edit, create, barcode scan). The full-page editor is
  retired from the navigation surface.
- **Inline edit**: view-mode fields flip to inputs in place within the
  same two-column grid so the surface doesn't change shape.
- **Header actions** (Edit / Delete in view, Cancel / Save in edit)
  sit as icon buttons in the top right of the sheet, mirroring
  RecipeView's chrome pattern. Red Close + Delete + Cancel, green
  Save.
- **In Stock derives from quantity** — `quantity === 0` reads as out
  of stock, `null` or `> 0` reads as in stock. The explicit toggle
  was retired. Items you keep but never count (salt, oil) stay in
  stock without needing a number.

### Appearance + chrome
- **Trace Every Recipe — From Pantry to Plate**: new tagline across
  the README, sidebar, About card, Wizard welcome, and PWA manifest.
- **Gradient page-header banner** as a middle option between Animated
  and Off. New users land on Gradient as the default; existing users
  keep whatever they had.
- **Compact page header** when banners are off — saves ~40px on
  every page without the illustrated SVG.
- **"You're All Set" Wizard celebration** before landing on the
  Recipes tab — trophy icon + confetti, ~1.8s beat. Honors
  prefers-reduced-motion.
- **Title case sweep** across UI chrome: relative times ("3 Days
  Ago"), heatmap stats ("117 Cooks · 80 Active Days"), recipe header
  ("Last Cooked", "Cooked N Times"), nutrition box ("Servings Per
  Recipe").
- **Native number-input spinner buttons hidden** globally — every
  number input across the app renders without the up/down arrows.
- **40×40 page-header action buttons** standardized across routes to
  match the floating menu button. No more mixed 30/34/40 px sizing.

### Scheduled backups
- **Auto-backup**: schedule full backups daily, weekly, or monthly on
  the server side, plus a local-mode equivalent on Android. Optional
  retention window auto-prunes older snapshots.
- **Backup error toasts** when the list fetch fails (was a silent
  empty list).

### OIDC SSO
- **RP-initiated logout** on PWA and Android — signing out of
  CookTrace also signs you out of the identity provider when the
  provider supports the end-session endpoint.

### Dependency upgrades
- **Svelte 4 → 5** with the `runes: false` + `compatibility.componentApi: 4`
  compat shim. Same component API, smaller runtime.
- **Vite 5 → 7** + **vite-plugin-pwa 0.19 → 1.3**.
- **Express 4 → 5** with the new `path-to-regexp` v8 wildcard syntax.
- **bcryptjs 2 → 3** (ESM).
- **nodemailer 8.0.3 → 8.0.7**.

### Diagnostics
- **Image cache URL hashing** — fixes a collision bug where two
  OpenFoodFacts products whose URLs end with the same filename
  (`front_en.4.400.jpg`) would overwrite each other in the local
  cache and display each other's pictures.
- **Log + crash file share via Directory.Cache** so the receiving app
  (Drive, Files, Solid Explorer) actually gets the file contents
  instead of the share-intent's title text.

## v0.11.0-beta.1 (2026-05-11)

Polish and power pass across every primary surface. Diary, Recipes,
Pantry, Shopping, Manage, and the share flow all picked up real
features without changing the underlying shape of the app.

### Diary v2
- **Meal-type slots** on planned and logged cooks (breakfast, lunch,
  dinner, snack) with a chip picker in the planner and the log dialog
- **Per-cook rating** separate from the recipe's overall rating, so
  one bad attempt doesn't drag down a five-star recipe
- **Stats card** at the top with This Week, Current Streak, Longest
  Streak, and Most Cooked This Month. Current-streak has a grace
  window so today not being cooked yet doesn't reset the run
- **Cook activity heatmap**: GitHub-style contribution graph over
  the last year, sized to fill the card on desktop and horizontally
  scrollable on phones. Click a cell to jump the Month view there
- **Photos view**: chronological tile grid of every cook photo, with
  rating and multi-photo indicators. The lightbox pages between
  siblings on multi-photo cooks
- **Filter by recipe**: chip and picker apply across List, Month,
  and Photos. Dedicated empty state when the filter has no matches
  in the visible range
- **Dashboard layout on wide screens**: heatmap and stats card go
  side-by-side at 1280px and above instead of stacking, freeing
  screen room for the actual entries

### Sharing
- **Recipe card** moved from a server-rendered URL to a client-side
  PNG attached to the share sheet. Works fully offline, every
  recipient gets a real image inline regardless of channel
- **Full recipe content** on the card (hero, title, ingredients,
  numbered steps) instead of a teaser image. Plain-text version
  rides along in the share text body so Mail, SMS, and iMessage
  carry the recipe too
- **Pagination for long recipes**: one PNG per page (about 1500px
  tall max) so nothing gets cut off, and the share sheet receives
  all pages when the platform supports multi-file sharing
- **Shopping list card**: same client-side aesthetic as the recipe
  card, plus a Share as Text option for plain clipboard / SMS use
- **Brand mark** in every share-card footer next to the wordmark
- **Recipe View share icon** in the header so you don't have to back
  out to the list and long-press to share what you're reading
- **Desktop multi-page download fix**: staggered downloads so
  Chromium delivers every page after the user approves the prompt

### Pantry
- **Expiration dates** UI on items: date picker in the editor, an
  amber or red banner on the list when anything is within seven
  days (or already past), and a per-card expiry pill
- **Recipe usage pill** ("Used in N") on every card, with the count
  computed via a single ingredient-scan pass
- **Sort menu** in the toolbar: A to Z, Last Updated, Most Used,
  Expires Soon. Non-default sorts flatten the category grouping
  so the order isn't fighting the structure

### Shopping
- **Add from Meal Plan** bulk-imports the ingredients from every
  planned cook in a date range. Dedupes by name and unit (summing
  quantities when both sides have one), honours the existing
  "only missing from pantry" filter
- **Share** action in the header with image or plain-text options

### Recipes
- **Bulk Add to Cookbook** from the multi-select toolbar so a batch
  of recipes lands in a cookbook in one operation

### Manage hub
- **Usage badges** on Recipe Categories, Pantry Categories, and
  Units (in addition to Tags and Kitchen Gear, which already had
  them). Mint pill when in use, dim border-only pill when zero,
  so stale taxonomies stand out
- **Material Symbols icon picker** for Pantry Categories: visual
  grid with search instead of typing icon names from memory
- **Drag-reorder** on Recipe and Pantry Categories matching the
  existing Cookbooks pattern

### Micro-interactions
- **Heart pop** on the recipe favorite toggle and **star pop** on
  per-cook ratings: small scale-up-and-settle keyframes that
  honour `prefers-reduced-motion`

## v0.10.0-beta.1 — first beta (2026-05-08)

First beta tag on the dev repo. Everything from the build-out plus
the polish phases (1–11) is shipped, end-to-end, and documented.
README is a complete tour. No public release repo yet.

### What landed since v0.1.0-dev
- **Importers** — URL scrape, paste/upload (txt, JSON, JSON-LD,
  schema.org), and Mealie / Tandoor / Paprika export-zip flows
- **NutriTrace federation** — proxy + Settings UI + connectivity test;
  ingredient food-link picker; cooked-recipe → NT diary log
- **Recipe view polish** — sticky search, sticky save bar in editor,
  drag-reorder for ingredients AND steps, step text markdown
  formatting, print stylesheet, recipe-card SVG share, route
  transitions, category color stripe along card edge
- **Pantry polish** — slide-up sheet with in-place edit, inline
  nutrient cards with FDA-style %DV, sub-sheet for linked recipes,
  inline cross-family unit converter (~250-entry density catalog),
  cookbook fraction typography
- **Recipe extras** — categories with color, comments (rich-text,
  bold/italic/lists), cookbooks collections, recipe sharing,
  kitchens, kitchen gear field
- **Trace AI** — persistent chat history per user with rate limiting,
  multi-provider config (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Ollama)
- **Backup audit** — full-backup now captures recipe_categories,
  recipe_comments, pantry_categories, custom_units, disabled_units,
  cookbooks, recipe_cookbook_links, recipe_shares, kitchens,
  kitchen_members in addition to core tables
- **i18n sweep** — 442-key en.json, zero missing keys

## v0.1.0-dev — full app build-out (2026-05-04)

CookTrace went from an empty shell to a feature-complete recipe app
across a single intensive day of dev work. Every tab is real, every
Slice 1–2 item is shipped, and Phases 3–6 of the roadmap are in.

### Recipes
- Full recipe model: name, description, hero image, **rating (★)**,
  **favorite (♥)**, **yield text** (e.g. "12 cookies"), prep / cook
  minutes, default servings, **scaling chips** (×0.5/×1/×2/×3) plus a
  custom serving input
- **Ingredient groups** — Mealie-style sections like "Sauce" or
  "Dough"; default is one unnamed group rendering as a flat list
- Steps support an **optional summary** rendering as "Step 1: Preheat
  Oven" when filled
- **FDA-style Nutrition Facts box** between Steps and Notes — full
  nutriment catalog (31 fields), sub-row indenting, %DV column,
  vitamins/minerals separated by a thick rule. Sodium ↔ salt
  auto-derives via the EU regulatory factor with a calculator-icon
  badge on the derived row
- **Cook history** list (date / notes / photo / edit / delete) below
  the box once you've cooked it at least once
- "I cooked this" opens a **Cook Log dialog** (date picker + notes +
  photo) rather than a one-click log
- **Cook Mode** — "Start cooking" button requests Screen Wake Lock,
  enlarges body text, persists ingredient + step checkboxes per
  recipe in localStorage so a stove interruption doesn't lose your
  place. Sticky banner with Reset Checks + Exit
- **Long-press / right-click** any recipe card → context menu: Open ·
  Favorite · Plan a cook · Add to shopping list · Duplicate · Share
  card · Delete

### Recipes list cards
- Hero image, favorite-heart overlay, 5-star rating row, time +
  serves + last-cooked + **pantry-match pill** (color-coded full /
  partial / none — counts ingredients you have in stock)
- Search, action-sheet "+" with four import paths (Manual · URL ·
  Paste/upload · Photo when Trace AI is configured)

### Pantry
- Real CRUD page replacing the stub: alphabetical list with in-stock
  toggle (optimistic), search, filter chips (All / In stock / Out),
  Add modal with name + quantity + unit (UnitPicker) + notes +
  optional image. 36×36 thumbnail in the list row.
- **Auto-populates from recipe saves** — every ingredient name you
  use in a recipe becomes a pantry row (case-insensitive dedup, "Flour"
  + "flour" share one entry). Recipe ingredient → `pantry_item_id`
  links happen server-side in a single transaction on save.
- "X / Y in pantry" pill on every recipe card, computed server-side
  from the user's in-stock set.

### Diary (Phase 3)
- Two views: **List** (60d back / 30d forward, grouped by date with
  Planned/Past separators) and **Month** (calendar grid with pill
  entries per day, today ringed in accent color)
- **Plan-a-cook** modal: date picker + searchable recipe picker → one
  click writes a `kind=planned` cook_diary row
- Each entry: clickable thumbnail navigates to the recipe; "Cooked"
  button on planned entries one-taps the conversion; delete on every row

### Shopping (Phase 4)
- Quick-add row at the top: name + quantity + UnitPicker + add
- Items grouped by aisle (Other pinned bottom), checkboxes per row
  with optimistic toggle + revert-on-error
- "X remaining · Y checked" status bar with bulk Clear-Checked action
- **"Add from recipe"** opens a modal with searchable recipe picker
  + "only add what's missing from pantry" toggle (default on). One
  tap pulls the missing ingredients onto the list with their quantity
  + unit + pantry_id link
- Empty state CTA points at the same flow

### URL recipe scraper (Phase 4)
- POST `/api/recipes/scrape` fetches any URL, parses
  schema.org/Recipe JSON-LD, normalises into our shape (handles @graph
  nesting, HowToSection trees, ISO 8601 durations, all standard
  nutrition fields, keyword splitting), then runs through the regular
  create flow so pantry-linking + sodium/salt derivation apply.
- SSRF-guarded: http(s)-only, blocks loopback + private IP ranges,
  8s timeout, 5MB cap, identifies as CookTrace via User-Agent.
- Wired into the "+" menu URL import dialog.

### Recipe-card share (Phase 6)
- GET `/api/recipes/:id/card.png` returns a server-rendered
  Pinterest-style 600×800 SVG (hero image with bottom-fade overlay,
  word-wrapped name, time/serves/yield subtitle, COOKTRACE
  watermark). Renders correctly in browsers, Slack, Discord, iMessage
  link previews. Wired into the long-press menu Share action via
  navigator.share / clipboard fallback.

### NutriTrace federation (Phase 5)
- Settings → "NutriTrace federation" section: URL + access-token
  fields, show/hide on the token, **Test** button (proxies through
  the server to NT `/api/auth/me`), enable toggle (gated on
  URL+token).
- `/api/nt/test`, `/api/nt/foods`, `/api/nt/log-meal` server proxy —
  bearer token never leaves the server.
- Foundation ready; auto-log-cooked-to-NT-diary + Pantry NT food
  picker land as consumer wiring tickets next.

### Trace AI assistant (Phase 5)
- Floating chat FAB on every page (gradient circle with the TraceFace
  mascot) — only renders when AI is enabled in Settings.
- Slide-up chat panel with conversation history, "thinking" dots,
  refresh-to-clear, multi-line input that submits on Enter.
- Settings → Trace Assistant: enable toggle, assistant name, provider
  dropdown (Claude / OpenAI / Gemini / OpenAI-compatible), API key
  with show/hide, custom base URL when "OpenAI-compat" is picked,
  model dropdown / freeform field, **Test** button. envLocks.ai
  disables the key field when AI is configured server-side via env
  vars.
- Server proxy at `/api/ai/chat` was already in place — Trace.svelte
  just calls it. API key never reaches the WebView.

### Ingredient unit picker
- Replaced the previous datalist with a full **UnitPicker** combobox.
  37 cooking units in 5 categories (Volume US, Volume Metric, Weight
  US, Weight Metric, Count / descriptive). Click opens for browse
  (shows everything regardless of saved value); type to switch into
  search mode and filter. Free-text fallback for splash / drizzle /
  to taste / etc. Custom units configurable via a `customUnits`
  setting (Setting UI to pick coming).

### Image picker (Slice 2D)
- `ImagePicker.svelte` — three buttons (Camera / Upload / URL), ghost
  styling, capped 420px-wide centered preview. Camera works on PWA
  via `getUserMedia` (in-page popup with capture button) and on
  Capacitor via `@capacitor/camera`. Wired into RecipeEditor,
  CookLogDialog, and Pantry edit modal.

### Settings (refactored to NT-uniform)
- Every section is now collapsible (chevron toggles, slide
  animation, closed by default). Header: accent-colored material
  icon in a rounded square.
- Theme is a `<select>` dropdown ("System default" / "Dark" /
  "Light"). Navigation style + measurement system also dropdowns.
- 12 named accent presets (Mint, Blue, Red, Purple, Orange, Teal,
  Pink, Yellow, Indigo, Lime, Rose, Cyan) plus a custom-color swatch
  with conic-gradient rainbow.
- **Custom color picker sheet** — live colored preview with hex
  readout, Hue slider, Saturation slider (gradient updates as
  hue/lightness change), Lightness slider, RGB inputs (R / G / B
  three-up), Hex input with color dot. All math copied verbatim from
  NutriTrace.
- New sections: **Nutrition** (visible-nutriments picker — checkbox
  per nutriment grouped by category, defaults / show-all buttons),
  **NutriTrace federation**, **Trace Assistant** (real config),
  **Notifications** (still placeholder for cook-day reminders).

### Internationalization
- **Energy unit** — independent setting (Calories / Kilojoules), not
  tied to measurement system. Most metric countries (UK / EU / Canada)
  still default to kcal; AU / NZ use kJ. Stored values always stay in
  kcal — switching is display-only (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ).
- **Wizard locale auto-detect** — `navigator.language` seeds the
  defaults: `en-AU` / `en-NZ` → kJ + metric, `en-US` → kcal + imperial,
  everyone else → kcal + metric. Fully overridable in Settings.
- **Trace AI prompt** — system prompt tells the assistant the user's
  preferred measurement system + energy unit so its responses come back
  in the right units on the first try (no "convert this for me"
  round-trip).

### Other
- `feedback_dev_versioning.md` honored — no version bump.
- `cheerio` added to server dependencies for the URL scraper.
- Banner: open stockpot with rising animated steam (no lid, no
  bubbles, no chef-hat).

## v0.1.0-dev.0 — Foundation fork (2026-05-03)

Initial CookTrace fork from NutriTrace v1.0.0-rc.14. Carries over the auth,
OIDC SSO, settings sync, sidebar/bottom-nav layout, Capacitor shell, and
Docker deploy stack. NutriTrace-specific food/diary/wellness/Fitbit/Garmin/
Withings/Mealie code stripped; CookTrace recipe/pantry/cook-diary/shopping
schema added (empty stubs in this version — feature work follows in Phase 1+).

This release is a runnable empty shell suitable for further development.
Nothing is end-user usable yet.
